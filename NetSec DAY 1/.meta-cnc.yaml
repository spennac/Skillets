# more complex skillets may express a dependency on another skillet that should be loaded before this one.
# For example, a set of skillets may build off of a single 'golden config' that contains shared configuration
# As this skillet is very simple, there is no need to build on another one.
  
# Labels allow grouping and type specific options and are generally only used in advanced cases

# Snippets is an ordered list of configuration xml fragments that will be pushed to the PAN-OS NGFW. The xpath
# determines where in the configuration hierarchy the xml fragment will be set. 'file' indicates the name of the file
# to load and parse. Jinja2 style variables will be variable interpolated using the values of the 'variables' defined
# in the 'variables' section.
